===============================

Nothing special here, just trying to learn some Python

### But why Python?
> Python community has its own unique character. Python has a culture which finds an ideal balance between fast-moving innovation and diligent caution. It emphasizes readability, minimizes "magic," treats documentation as a first-class concern, and has a traditon of well-tested, backward-compatible releases in both the core language and its ecosystem of libraries. It blends approachability for beginners with maintainability for large projects, which has enabled its presence in fields as diverse as scientific computing, video games, systems automation, and the web.

 - for PART III: one of PART II + some specialized tools or frameworks




GIT configuration
=================
What do I need to do to configure git properly for Github?

NOTE: Assuming cmder, git and git-lfs is already installed (e.g. with chocolatey)

NOTE: Assuming Github is configured to keep your email private

1. `git config --global user.name "tset-noitamotua"`
2. `git config --global user.email "tset-noitamotua@users.noreply.github.com"`
3. `git config --global credential.helper wincred`
    
    NOTE: first time you use e.g. `git push` you will be prompt for credentials though
